In this project, I learned about the RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) model and its application in customer segmentation, which has been instrumental in enhancing my analytical skills.

Key Insights

RFM Analysis: I discovered how to evaluate customer behavior effectively by analyzing their purchasing patterns. This model helps businesses identify valuable customers and tailor marketing strategies to enhance engagement.

Data Preparation: I learned the significance of data cleaning and preparation, including handling missing values and converting date formats, which are crucial for accurate analysis.

Segmentation Techniques: By applying quantiles to R, F, and M scores, I successfully classified customers into segments such as 'VIP/Loyal', 'Potential Loyal', and 'At Risk'. This segmentation allows for more targeted marketing efforts.

Visualization Skills: Utilizing Plotly for data visualization, I created interactive charts and graphs that effectively communicated the findings. This included bar charts, treemaps, and heatmaps to illustrate customer segments and their characteristics.

Tools and Libraries Used

Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis, including reading CSV files and performing aggregations.

Plotly: To create interactive visualizations that enhance the presentation of data insights.

Datetime: To manage and manipulate date and time data effectively.

This project has not only improved my technical abilities but has also provided valuable insights into customer analytics.
